This project is the first time I've used ruby to scrape web pages. 

It uses a web scraper to collect data:

- Access a webpage's HTML
- Identify proper css selectors for parsing through data. 
- Write a Ruby script to scrape Wikipedia and Airbnb and export the information into a database.

AirBNB now uses React, so more difficult to scrape.
I'm using the [3taps](https://3taps.com/) API to access Craig's list instead of scraping.
