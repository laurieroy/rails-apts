# Craislist_scraper -WIP

This is a sample website to show apartments available in a certain location. It is for personal and educational use, not commercial.

This is my first scraping project, I scraped Craiglist for available apartments in Fargo, ND.

<!-- A rake task runs this scraper every 10 mins. -->

- Scrape Data. I created a csv file, manually examined it and iteratively cleaned it up
- Create Model (Heading, Time Listed, Neighborhood, Link, Price)	# TODO: Add bedrooms, sq_footage
- Crate Rake Task to populate db
